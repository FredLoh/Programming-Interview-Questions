What is the difference between a Wireframe and a Mockup	A wireframe showcases functionality, it is essentially a blueprint for a website/product.<br /><br />A mockup is a realistic representation of what a product will look like.
What is a use case?	A list of actions or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role (known in the Unified Modeling Language as an actor) and a system, to achieve a goal.
<div>What is the difference between a class digram and a entity relationship diagram?</div>	A chart that visually represents the relationships between database entries.
What is an acceptance criteria?	Acceptance Criteria are the conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by a user, customer, or in the case of system level functionality, the consuming system.
What is SCRUM?	"<div>Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development. It defines ""a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal"", challenges assumptions of the ""traditional, sequential approach"" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.</div><div><br /></div><div>A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called requirements volatility), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approachâ€”accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.</div>"
What is Git?	Git is a version control system, that is decentralized which allows for easy offline access.
Define Scalability	Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.<br /><br />For example, it can refer to the capability of a system to increase its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.
What is cohesion? What is coupling?	Cohesion refers to what a class or module does. &nbsp;The higher the cohesion the more focused it is on its role.<br /><br />Coupling refers to how related two classes or modules are to one another and how changes in one code affect the other.
What is polymorphism?	Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.
